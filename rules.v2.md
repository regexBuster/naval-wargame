# Setup

# Beginning Play
* The game is played in a turn based method based on initiative scores. To determine the order of ships each ship rolls a twenty sided die and the highest number is the first ship to move and the next highest is the next to move. 
	* In the event of a tie the ship with the most max movement goes first.
	* In the result of a second tie reroll until a difference in values is found.
* The list of ship initiatives, initiative track, is not rerolled during the course of the game and stays the same every round.
* When the bottom of the initiative track is reached the next round starts at the top of the initiative track.
* When it is a ship's initiative they get to act by using their movement, a port and starboard action, and an officer action which is better explained in the next section.

# Turn Description

## Movement
**Basic Movement**
* Movement happens from the bow of the ship, the front, and can be broken up into multiple usages, up to a max movement speed, between other actions.
* Movement is preformed one hex at a time up to the speed of the ship in order to allow for the breaking up of movement around other actions, however it is not neccessary to break up your movement action.
* Ships must move at half of their max movement on their initiative.
	* However, if a ship operated at half speed the turn before it may decrease it's movement to zero, effectively stopping.
	* A ship may also stay at half speed or return to full movement speed if operating at half max movement speed the turn before 
	* Half is determined by dividing by two and rounding down which also means that if max movement is only one the ship may stop on any turn.

**Turning**
* Ships during their movement action can choose to turn the ship instead of moving directly forward.
* Depending on the orientation of the ship it will have two or three hexes to move into in front of it ad it can choose to move into any of these hexes with its bow.
* *add some pictures of a board with ships turning*
* **Aggressive Maneuver: Come About**
	* Using all of your movement to turn in one direction is a rough movement which can cause some of your crew to lose footing.
