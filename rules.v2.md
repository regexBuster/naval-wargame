# Setup

# Beginning Play
* The game is played in a turn based method based on initiative scores. To determine the order of ships each ship rolls a twenty sided die and the highest number is the first ship to move and the next highest is the next to move. 
	* In the event of a tie the ship with the most max movement goes first.
	* In the result of a second tie reroll until a difference in values is found.
* The list of ship initiatives, initiative track, is not rerolled during the course of the game and stays the same every round.
* When the bottom of the initiative track is reached the next round starts at the top of the initiative track.
* When it is a ship's initiative they get to act by using their movement, a port and starboard action, and an officer action which is better explained in the next section.

# Turn Description

## Movement
**Basic Movement**
* Movement happens from the bow of the ship, the front, and can be broken up into multiple usages, up to a max movement speed, between other actions.
* Movement is preformed one hex at a time up to the speed of the ship in order to allow for the breaking up of movement around other actions, however it is not neccessary to break up your movement action.
* Ships must move at half of their max movement on their initiative.
	* However, if a ship operated at half speed the turn before it may decrease it's movement to zero, effectively stopping.
	* A ship may also stay at half speed or return to full movement speed if operating at half max movement speed the turn before 
	* Half is determined by dividing by two and rounding down which also means that if max movement is only one the ship may stop on any turn.

**Turning**
* Ships during their movement action can choose to turn the ship instead of moving directly forward.
* Depending on the orientation of the ship it will have two or three hexes to move into in front of it ad it can choose to move into any of these hexes with its bow.
* *add some pictures of a board with ships turning*
* **Aggressive Maneuver: Come About**
	* Using all of your movement to turn in one direction is a rough movement which can cause some of your crew to lose footing.
	* The ship's owner must pass a 10 (+situational modifiers) check with a d20 in order to avoid Overboard Saves (see Overboard Saves in the Specifics heading).
	* Regardless of the outcome the ship operates on half speed during its next turn or is able to stop in its place.

## Port and Starboard Action

**Firing Weapons**

**Reloading Weapons**
* Every weapon needs to reload after being shot. To do so you must use the action of the weapons side to reload them so that you can shoot on the next turn's action.

**Brace**
* Bracing a side of your ship reduces the Casualties from Casualty Damage and Overboard Saves by half. You may take this action for both sides of a ship applying the halving only to that side of the ship.
* For this action's benefits to be applied you must take the action to brace befor ramming or being rammed. You gain the benefits of this action until the start of ship's next initiative. 

**Boarding**
* If your ship is attached to another and that attachment says that it grants you the ability to board is an action that takes up the action of both sides of your ship however.
* You choose how many crew members you want to leave the ship, as long as you leave at least more than or equal to the amount for a skeleton crew.
* *Do the actual fighting for boarding later after you get a rules structure worked up*
