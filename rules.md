#### **Class**
* **1st Rate Ships:** 1st Rate Ships are the big dogs which dominate battles on the sea. Since these are quite expanisve and grand, most navies only bring them out in dire circumstances. However, even with the ginormous costs to maintain and run them they get the job done when they are brought out onto the sea. Most 1st Rate ships are comprised of a large three deck system. The first containing many cannons, masts, and the wheel up on the aft castle. The second deck contains many more of the cannons in the middeck, crew cabins towards the bow, and officer quarters in the back with the kitchen. The third deck is often only for storage but may be customized with a brig in some ships.
* **2nd Rate Ships:** 2nd Rate Ships are more often seen on the seas than the 1st Rate Ships. These ships often take up multiple different types of functions from pursuit of bandits to being bandits themselves. 2nd Rate Ships can easily handle themselves on the sea without having to be the monsterous fortresses that the 1st Rate Ships are. Generally 2nd Rate Ships have two decks, although some may boast a third deck. The bottom deck holds some storage in the middeck with crew cabins in the fore and officer's quarters, with the kitchen, in the aft. However, the top deck is quite similar to that of a 1st Rate Ship.
* **Unrated Ships:** Unrated ships make up for their size with their high speeds and good manuverability. This rate of ships holds only a few crew members and weapons making it hard for them to fight on the sea. Due to that restriction, most Unrated Ships look to board bigger ships and win in physical combat. While Unrated Ships can have two decks they also may not have a bottom deck at all and opt for a ship with purely an upper deck. Unrated Ships are quite hard to classify as they have many different characteristics that change from ship to ship and should just be evaluated ship by ship rather than have an over arching classifier on them.

#### Speed
* Ships have a certain amount of Speed points which they can expend each turn. Smaller ships tend to have more speed as it aids them with their manuverability and opprotunities to board during combat. For a more informative look at the movement of ships during combat look for the Movement section under the Combat heading.

#### Number of Masts
*  The Number of Masts on a ship change the amount of Rigging HP that a ship has during naval combat. For more information on Rigging HP look under Hit Points in the Combat heading.

#### AC
* AC, or a ship's Armour Class, is a representation of how hard it is to hit a ship. As a ship's rating goes down it gains more AC due to the illusivity caused by a smaller craft and quicker manuvering. This is also the base number which you roll against in combat when trying to hit a ship with cannons.

#### Damage Threshold
* *(This will likely go unused unless an alternate means to destroy a ship is taken, alternative to normal firings from a ship's weapons)* Due to ships being a complicated mess of wood a beams a ships's Damage Threshold provides a pool of damage that a ship can withstand, each round, before it takes real damage against its HP. This does not apply to Siege Weapons whos damage is dealt directly to the HP of a ship. 

#### Hit Points (HP) and Effective HP
* **HP:** A ship's HP is the amount of damage it can withstand during combat before it beings to sink. A ship becomes crippled when at or below its Effective HP and begins sinking when the HP reaches 0. For more information on sinking look in Hit Points under the Combat heading.
* **Effective HP:** A ship's Effective HP is the threshold which signifies that a ship has become so damaged that it is unable to operate at normal capactiy. This makes the ship have to deal with many restrictions on the actions and movements that he ship can take. This is better explained for combat under the Combat heading.

#### Siege Weapons (min/max)
* Siege Weapons are the type of high damage weapon of choice employed on a ship, most commonly being cannons. These are outlined much better in the Weapons and Items section found later in this heading.
* **Maximum (max):** The maximum number of Siege Weapons is only the maximum number of Siege Weapons that can be held on one side of a ship at any given time, port or starboard.
* **Minimum (min):** The minimum number of Siege Weapons is only a suggestition towards how few weapons that you should have on any given side of the ship, you can of course go under the recommended minimum if you so choose.

#### Skeleton Crew and Maximum Crew 
* **Maximum Crew:** A ship's Maximum Crew is the amount of crew members that a ship has at the beginning of any naval combat. This amount may change due to casualties from damages and people being tossed overboard for various reasons
* **Skeleton Crew:** A ship's Skeleton Crew is the lowest amount of crew that is recommended to run a ship. Running your ship at a crew amount less than this would impose disadvantages towards Siege Weapons checks to hit ships.

## Ship Customizations

*For simplicity I'll not add these yet*

# Combat

#### Before Creating Initiative
1. Determine the locations and headings of ships. Noramlly ships should be positioned around 24 or less hexes away as it provides room for manuvering without making the game take too long to start.
2. *Optionally* Determine the weather and ocean condtions that the ships are battling in.
	* This may affeect the ability to make some actions in the future.
3. *Optionally* Determine the wind direction. Either come to a decision with other players or roll it randomly.
4. *Determine if this is a fun rule later* Clarify the positions of any naval officers aboard your ships

#### During/After Creating Initiative
5. Roll initatives from a 20 sided die and create a list so you don't forget order.
6. Ships can take *x amount* actions during their initiative.
7. Ships may also use all or some of its movement between any of their other actions.
8. At the end of the turn, each ship that has sustained damage must calculate their casualties.
9. Then, ships continue following the initiative until one of the following end conditions are met:
	* One side surenders, or a cease fire is called (only stops combat if accepted by both sides).
	* All ships of one side fall beneath their Effective HP. *See if this comes up often as most people would surrender at this point*
	* If all ships on both sides fall beneath their Effective HP. *Gives time to decide if a cease fire is optimal*

## Movement
Movement happens from the bow of the ship, no matter the size of the ship. Movement is also preformed one hex at a time up to the speed of the ship. Ships cannot stop immediately and must take at least 1/2 of their movement per turn. Ships who moved 1/2 of their movement the turn before can now reduce their speed to effectively 0. When starting the ship from 0 it must use the same process of 1/2 speed for one turn before returning to full speed.
*Optional Rule* Moving incurs a challenge roll of 8 to pass and successfully navigate. If you fail this check the ship will use up another point of speed to continue moving in the direction of travel, if you have no more speed left you still do this and just lose a speed point next round. If you are turning rather than going straight you continue turning in the same direction.

#### Turning
Ships must move forward unless they have stopped. With their speed they may move forward or forward diagonally, there is generally 2 to 3 positions that a ship can move to. 
If a ship turns the bow of the ship advances into the new hex and the aft is situated to the reverse of the heading. *The middle of the ship may not sit nicely on hexes but the bow and the aft should always be on a full hex.* Unranked ships do not have this problem because their aft will always be in the hex that the bow held before movement.

#### Evasive Maneuver: Come About 
This action can be take by a ship in order to position themselves perpendicular to their current orientation to either direction. First, a DC 10 (+situational modifiers) check is made to see if the ship successfully performs the manuver. Then another DC 10 (+situational modifiers) check is made to avoid Overboard Saves. This manuver takes the whole speed of the ship and makes the ship move at 1/2 speed the next turn, you may used the next turn to halt the ship like normal. 

Consecutive manuvers cause disadvantage on both checks, to do the manuver and for overboard checks. Also, the DC checks for Overboard Saves is increased by 3. An initial failure of the check to do the manuver causes the manuver to fail and an increase of 3 for the DC of the Overboard Save check.

Unrated ships rotate 180 degrees when they come about. Their aft occupies the space the bow was in before the manuver and the bow flips in relation to it. Overboard Saves gain a +5 to the DC (and +2 for each consecutive maneuver).

#### Wind *(an optional rule)*
| d12 | Direction | d12 | Direction |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | North -> South | 7 | No Wind Bonus |
| 2 | NE -> SW | 8 | Unfavorable |
| 3 | E -> W | 9 | S -> N |
| 4 | SE -> NW | 10 | SW -> N |
| 5 | Favorable | 11 | EW -> E |
| 6 | No Wind Bonus | 12 | NW -> SE |

* Favorable
	* Ships gain a bonus 1 speed point when sailing with the wind
* Unfavorable
	* Ships always move at half speed when sailing into the wind
	* Unrated crafts ignore this penalty

#### Conditions *(an optional rule)*
| Condition | Effect |
| :-: | :-: |

*not implemented because of captaining stuff not being here yet*

#### Overboard
Overboard Saves operate on a beat-by system, the higher or lower you roll in comparison to the DC dictates how well you've done on the check.

#### Crew Overboard Saves
| Result | Effect |
| :-: | :-: |
| Success by 5 or more | All Save |
| Success | 1d4-1 crew overboard |
| Failure by 7 or less | 1d4 crew fall overboard |
| Failure by 8 or more | 1d4+2 crew fall overboard |

## Damage / Firing

#### Targets

* The Ship
	* Targeting the ship deals damages to the ship's HP. The hull is the main target of the damage put against the ship. Damage done to the hull must surpass the damage threshold of the ship (per attack). Attacks targeting the ship adds to the Casualty Damage equal to half of what was delt to the ship. 
* The Rigging
	* The rigging relates the the sails, masts, and any other aspects of the ship related to movement. Attacks against the rigging cause disadvantage and -3 to the attack roll. Damage to the rigging affects the Rigging HP rather than the normal HP. There is no damage threshold for the rigging however it does not cause more casulaties.
* The Crew
	* The Crew defends with the AC of the ship, and the crew also may not be targeted if the roll would already have disadvantage. No damage is given to the HP or Rigging HP rather the whole of it goes towards Casualty Damage.

#### Field of Fire
Ships have a cone of fire in which their siege weapons normally reach. The central, and slightly smaller cone, is the ship's Full Field where there is a clear shot and full damage is dealt. The slightly larger outer cone however, is known as the ship's Half Field where ships shot in this cone gain a +2 to AC.

* Unrated
	* Unrated ships have a 2 hex long field of fire with the outer one length of hexes making up the Half Field on both sides.
* 2nd Rate
	* 2nd Rate ships have a 3 hex long field with the outer one length of hexes making up the Half Field on both sides.
* 1st Rate
	* 1st Rate ships have a 4 hex long field with the outer two length of hexes making up the Half Field on both sides.

#### Raking Fire
When you ships in positioned in the fore or aft of an enemy ship and outside of its Port and Starboard Fields of Fire you gain a bonus while as you target either the bow or stern.
As long as you are in the appropriate location, you may roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the damage from ranged weapon attacks which target the enemy ship.

## Hit Points

#### Effective Hit Points
* Going Beneath Effective HP
	* *Captain Disadvantage Not in Yet just Placeholder*
	* Piloting actions have disadvantage
	* Siege Weapon Attacks have disadvantage

#### Sinking
When a ship is bought to 0 hit points, it is considered to be thinking. This causes the following complications:
* The ships speed become 0, regardless of the previous turn's speed
* All penalties gained from going under the Effective HP persist
* Repairs to the ship automatically fail
* The ship causes a block to Fields of Fire and fully submerges in 1d6+2 rounds

#### Rigging Hit Points
Each ship has 40 total Rigging HP per masts on the ship.  As these take damage, movement penalties occur as shown in the table.

| HP Remaining | Unrated | 2nd Rate | 1st Rate | Condition |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 51% or more | 21 or more HP | 41 or more HP | 61 or more HP | Full Effectiveness |
| 50% - 26% | 20 - 11 HP | 40 - 21 HP | 60 - 31 HP | No bonus from wind |
| 25% - 11% | 10 - 5 HP | 20 - 9 HP | 30 - 13 HP | No bonus/ penalties from wind AND 1/2 Speed |
| 10% or lower | 5 or lower HP | 8 or less HP | 12 or less HP | No bonus/ penalties from wind AND Speed is 1 |

## Casualties
At the end of each turn, take the total Casualy Damage and consult the table to see how many crew members have been lost.

| Tier | Casualty Damage | Casualties |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0 | <30 | No Casualties |
| 1 | 30 - 39 | 1 Casualty |
| 2 | 40 - 69 | 1d4-1 (minimum 1) |
| 3 | 70 - 119 | 1d4 (minimum 1) |
| 4 | 120 - 159 | 1d4+1 |
| 5 | 160 - 199 | 1d4+2 |
| 6 | >= 200 | 1d4+3 |
